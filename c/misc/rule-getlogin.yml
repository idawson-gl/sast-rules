  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-807: It's often easy to fool getlogin.  Sometimes it does not work at
      all, because some program messed up the utmp file.  Often, it gives only the
      first 8 characters of the login name. The user currently logged in on the controlling
      tty of our program need not be the user who started it.  Avoid getlogin() for
      security-related purposes (CWE-807)"
  pattern: "getlogin(...)"

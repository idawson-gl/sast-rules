    cwe: "CWE-20: This function is obsolete and not portable. It was in SUSv2 but
      removed by POSIX.2.  What it does exactly varies considerably between systems,
      particularly in where its prompt is displayed and where it gets its data (e.g.,
      /dev/tty, stdin, stderr, etc.). In addition, some implementations overflow buffers.

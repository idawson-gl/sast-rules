    Use getpwuid(geteuid()) and extract the desired information instead.
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-120: Exactly what cuserid() does is poorly defined (e.g., some systems
      use the effective uid, like Linux, while others like System V use the real uid).
      Thus, you can't trust what it does. It's certainly not portable (The cuserid
      function was included in the 1988 version of POSIX, but removed from the 1990
      version).  Also, if passed a non-null parameter, there's a risk of a buffer
      overflow if the passed-in buffer is not at least L_cuserid characters long (CWE-120)"
  pattern: "cuserid(...)"

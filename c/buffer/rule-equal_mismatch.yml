    This function is often discouraged by most C++ coding standards in favor of its safer
    alternatives provided since C++14. Consider using a form of this function that checks the
    second iterator before potentially overflowing it.
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-126: Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions
      (CWE-126)"

  - pattern: "equal(...)"
  - pattern: "mismatch(...)"
  - pattern: "is_permutation(...)"

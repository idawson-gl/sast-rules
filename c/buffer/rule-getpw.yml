    Use getpwuid() instead.
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-120: This function is dangerous; it may overflow the provided buffer.
      It extracts data from a 'protected' area, but most systems have many commands
      to let users modify the protected area, and it's not always clear what their
      limits are.  Best to avoid using this function altogether (CWE-676, CWE-120)"

  message: |
    Use posix_memalign instead (defined in POSIX's 1003.1d).  Don't switch to valloc(); it is
    marked as obsolete in BSD 4.3, as legacy in SUSv2, and is no longer defined in SUSv3.  In some
    cases, malloc()'s alignment may be sufficient.
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-676: On some systems (though not Linux-based systems) an attempt to
      free() results from memalign() may fail. This may, on a few systems, be exploitable.
      \ Also note that memalign() may not check that the boundary parameter is correct
      (CWE-676)"
  pattern-either:
  - pattern: "memalign(...)"

    Use a different algorithm, such as SHA-256, with a larger, non-repeating salt.
  metadata:
    cwe: "CWE-327: The crypt functions use a poor one-way hashing algorithm; since
      they only accept passwords of 8 characters or fewer and only a two-byte salt,
      they are excessively vulnerable to dictionary attacks given today's faster computing
      equipment (CWE-327)"

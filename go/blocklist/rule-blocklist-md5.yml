  message: |
    The MD5 message-digest algorithm has been cryptographically broken and is unsuitable for
    further use. It is recommended that the SHA-3, or BLAKE2 family of algorithms be used for
    non-password based cryptographic hashes instead. For password based cryptographic hashes,
    consider using the bcrypt or Argon2 family of cryptographic hashes.

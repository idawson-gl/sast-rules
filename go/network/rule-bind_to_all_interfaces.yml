  message: |
    Binding to all network interfaces can potentially open up a service to
    traffic on unintended interfaces, that may not be properly documented or
    secured. This plugin test looks for a string pattern “0.0.0.0” that may
    indicate a hardcoded binding to all network interfaces.

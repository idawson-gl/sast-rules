  message: |
    Using the unsafe package in Go gives you low-level memory management and many
    of the strength of the C language but also gives flexibility to the attacker of
    your application. The pointer arithmetic is one of the examples from the unsafe
    package which can be used for data leak, memory corruption or even execution of
    attackers own script.

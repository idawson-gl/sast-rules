  message: |
    A new cookie is created without the HttpOnly flag set. The HttpOnly flag is a directive to the
    browser to make sure that the cookie can not be red by malicious script. When a user is the
    target of a "Cross-Site Scripting", the attacker would benefit greatly from getting the session
    id for example.

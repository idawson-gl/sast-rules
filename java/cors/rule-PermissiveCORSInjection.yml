  message: |
    Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for
    JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must
    originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve
    up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's
    credentials, cull through it, and communicate it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible
    for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other
    domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should
    be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a
    malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way,
    leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.

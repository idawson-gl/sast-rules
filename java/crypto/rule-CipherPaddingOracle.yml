  message: |
    This specific mode of CBC with PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. An
    adversary could potentially decrypt the message if the system exposed the difference between
    plaintext with invalid padding or valid padding. The distinction between valid and invalid
    padding is usually revealed through distinct error messages being returned for each condition.

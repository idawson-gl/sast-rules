    The sensitive information may be valuable information on its own (such as a password), or it
    may be useful for launching other, more deadly attacks. If an attack fails, an attacker may use
    error information provided by the server to launch another more focused attack. For example, an
    attempt to exploit a path traversal weakness (CWE-22) might yield the full pathname of the
    installed application.

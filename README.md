# semgrep-rules

This is the central semgrep rule repository that hosts the semgrep rules
for the [GitLab semgrep analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep).

We follow the testing methodology laid out in this [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/08/write-vulnerability-detection-rules/).

The repository is structured as illustrated below:

``` bash
.
├── mappings
│   └── analyzer.yml
├── dist
│   └── pack.yml
├── c
│   ├── buffer
│   │   ├── rule-strcpy.yml
│   │   ├── test-strcpy.c
│   │   ├── rule-memcpy.yml
│   │   └── test-memcpy.c
│   └── ...
└── javascript
│   └── ...
└── python
│    ├── assert
│    │   ├── rule-assert.yml
│    │   └── test-assert.py
│    └── exec
│    │   ├── rule-exec.yml
│    │   ├── test-exec.yml
│    │   ├── rule-something.yml
│    │   └── test-something.yml
│    └── permission
│    │   ├── rule-chmod.yml
│    │   └── test-chmod.py
│    └── ...
└── ...
```

The structure above follows the pattern:
`<language>/<ruleclass>/{rule-<rulename>.yml, test-<rulename>\..*}` where
`language` denotes the target programming language, `<ruleclass>` is a
descriptive name for the class of issues the rule aims to detect and
`<rulename>` is a descriptive name for the actual rule.

We can have multiple test cases per rule (all prefixed with `test-`) and rule
files `rule-<rulename>.yml` that are prefixed with `rule-`; a rule file
contains a single semgrep rule.

The `mappings` and `dist` directories include the rule-pack configuration which
define the rules that should included into rule-packs and the resulting,
assembled rule-packs.

## Formatting guidelines

Rules contained in this repository have to adhere to the following format:

- Use `"` for strings, otherwise the YAML literal block |
- No collapsing of array elements
- max line-length/text-width: 100 characters
- indentation: 2 spaces
- every rule has to have a corresponding test-case
- if provided, comments-section at the top of the rule file
- every YAML files starts with `---`

The script `ci/autoformat.rb` automatically formats/rewrites all the rules files
so that they adhere to our guidelines listed above. It can be
executed by running `ci/autoformat.rb` within the sast-rules directory after
installing the gems `psych yaml fileutils` with `gem install psych yaml fileutils`.

## Mappings

The mappings directory in this repository contains YAML configuration files
that map native analyzer ids to the corresponding semgrep rules. These mappings
are digested by the [testing framework](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/gsoc-sast-vulnerability-rules/rule-testing-framework/rule-testing)
to perform an automated gap analysis; the goal of this analysis is to check
whether there is an unexpected deviation between semgrep (with the rules in this repository)
and a given analyzer.

In addition to that mappings are also used to automatically assemble
rule-packs. The snippet below illustrates an example mapping files for the
`bandit` analyzer. The `native_id` section includes some information about the
native id mappings. The actual rule mappings are defined in the `mappings`
section. Each mapping defines of which semgrep rules in this repository, a
bandit rules is composed. Note that the order of the rules in the files are
listed does matter at the moment, so that new mappings should be appended at
the end.

``` yaml
bandit:
  native_id:
    type: "bandit_test_id"
    name: "Bandit Test ID: $ID"
    value: "$ID"
  mappings:
  - id: "B301"
    rules:
      - "python/deserialization/rule-cpickle"
      - "python/deserialization/rule-shelve"
      - "python/deserialization/rule-pickle"
      - "python/deserialization/rule-dill"
  - id: "B101"
  # ...
```

## Contributing

If you know about a pattern that isn't present in this repo or refinements that
could be applied to the rules in this repository, you can contribute by opening
an issue, or even submit an improvement to the rule files/test cases in this
repository.

## Contribution instructions

After making changes to rules or mappings, make sure to run `./ci/deploy.sh <semantic version>`
and commit your updates to the `/dist` directory where `<semantic version>`
should correspond to the latest pusblished version in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)>

## Versioning and Changelog

We apply the following semantic versioning scheme to this repository:

1. patch version increment: for updated/patched/added rules.
1. minor version increment: backwards-compatible YAML schema changes (e.g., adding/removing optional fields).
1. major version increment: non-backwards-compatible YAML schema changes (e.g., adding/removing required fields)

## Rule deployment

## Rules that are not covered at the moment

### Bandit

#### Excluded patterns (1)
- B308: [django.utils.safestring.mark_safe](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.1/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b308-mark-safe) This rule is basically redundant with [B703](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b703_django_mark_safe.html)
- B109: [password_config_option_not_marked_secret](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b109_password_config_option_not_marked_secret.html) Not supported anymore since the plugin was removed
- B111: [execute_with_run_as_root_equals_true](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b111_execute_with_run_as_root_equals_true.html) Not supported anymore since the plugin was removed
- B322: [input](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_calls.html#b322-input) Not supported anymore since the plugin was removed
- B414: [import_pycryptodome](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blacklists/blacklist_imports.html#b414-import-pycryptodome) Not supported anymore since the plugin was removed


#### Adusted patterns (3)
- B503: [ssl_with_bad_defaults](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b503_ssl_with_bad_defaults.html) Our semgrep pattern captures both B503 and B502 because they are very similar and are both practically capturing insecure setting using outdated versions of encryption algorithms.
- B110: [try_except_pass](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b110_try_except_pass.html) The Semgrep rule checks the whole try except block whereas bandit reports every except case. The semgrep rule approximates the original rule behaviour looking at various permutations of except pass cases embedded in a try ... except block.
- B112: [try_except_continue](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b112_try_except_continue.html) The Semgrep rule checks the whole try except block whereas bandit reports every except case. The semgrep rule approximates the original rule behaviour looking at various permutations of except continue cases embedded in a try ... except block.

### ESLint

#### Patterns we were unable to migrate (1)

- `detect-unsafe-regex`: [Detects potentially unsafe regular expressions, which may take a very long time to run, blocking the event loop](https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-security/blob/main/docs/rules/detect-unsafe-regex.md): This problem is solved by applying set of conditional logic on each character of a target string. This cannot be accomplished in Semgrep.


### Gosec

#### Patterns we were unable to migrate (2)

- G104: [Metavariable types not supported for go at the moment](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/issues/1149)
- G307: [Deferring a method which returns an error](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/issues/1149)

### find-sec-bugs

Java, Scala

#### Out of scope patterns (25)

Out of scope patterns w.r.t. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/354762#rules-with-completion-status are all those patterns that are unrelated to Java.

#### Excluded patterns (6)

We excluded the patterns below because they are overly verbose; they are triggered by existing entry-points and do not indicate any vulnerability.

## Rule synchronization from Upstream scanners

Semgrep rules should be kept in-sync with upstream scanners regularly; here's the process:

- Pull the newly added rules from the analyzer's Upstream source (excluding the rules which could not be translated due to Semgrep limitations - see above).
- Translate newly identified rules into Semgrep-equivalent rules
- [Map](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/gsoc-sast-vulnerability-rules/playground/sast-rules#mappings) them against native analyzer's IDs in this repository.
- Generate a new ruleset distribution using the instructions described [above](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/secure/gsoc-sast-vulnerability-rules/playground/sast-rules#contribution-instructions).
- Add all the un-translatable rules into this file along with the reason against the downstream analyzer/
- Copy over the new ruleset distribution into [`Semgrep/rules`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/tree/main/rules) to reflect rule changes in the Analyzer.

For better tracking purposes, create a dedicated issue on rule synchronization cadence and create a sub-task for each semgrep-translated analyzer. The subtask should contain all the new rules that should be synchronized. Here's an example [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373117) that has followed the mentioned process.

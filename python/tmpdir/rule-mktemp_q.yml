  message: |
    Use tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile instead. From the official Python documentation: THIS FUNCTION
    IS UNSAFE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED. The file name may refer to a file that did not exist at some
    point, but by the time you getaround to creating it, someone else may have beaten you to the
    punch.

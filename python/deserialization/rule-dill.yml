  message: |
    Avoid using `dill`, which uses `pickle`, which is known to lead to code
    execution vulnerabilities. When unpickling, the serialized data could be manipulated
    to run arbitrary code. Instead, consider serializing the relevant data as JSON
    or a similar text-based serialization format.

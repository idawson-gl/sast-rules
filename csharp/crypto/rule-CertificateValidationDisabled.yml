  message: |
    When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted
    entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The software might
    connect to a malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the software might be
    deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.

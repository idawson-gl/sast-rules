  message: |
    The cipher text produced is susceptible to alteration by an adversary. The cipher provides no
    way to detect that the data has been tampered with. If the cipher text can be controlled by an
    attacker, it could be altered without detection. The use of AES in CBC mode with a HMAC is
    recommended guaranteeing integrity and confidentiality.

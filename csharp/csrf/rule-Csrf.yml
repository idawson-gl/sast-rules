  message: |
    An attacker could send a link to the victim. By visiting the
    malicious link, a web page would trigger a POST request (because it is a
    blind attack - the attacker doesnâ€™t see a response from triggered request
    and has no use from GET request and GET requests should not change a state
    on the server by definition) to the website. The victim would not be able
    to acknowledge that an action is made in the background, but his cookie
    would be automatically submitted if he is authenticated to the website.
    This attack does not require special interaction other than visiting a
    website.
